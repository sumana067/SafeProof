# 🛡️ SafeProof – On-Chain Warranty & Ownership Tracker

> A simple and transparent way to verify **product ownership** and **warranty validity** directly on the blockchain.  
> Powered by Solidity. Built for trust. 🌐

---

## 💫 Project Description

**SafeProof** is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that brings **product authenticity**, **ownership history**, and **warranty tracking** to the blockchain.  
Manufacturers can register their products on-chain, while buyers can transfer ownership and verify warranty validity anytime — without relying on intermediaries.  

Think of it as a **digital proof-of-ownership ledger** that lives forever on Ethereum (or any compatible chain). 🔗  




## ⚙️ What It Does

SafeProof helps you:

1. **Register new products** on the blockchain (only the manufacturer can do this).  
2. **Record product details** such as ID, name, warranty duration, and purchase date.  
3. **Transfer ownership** safely from one person to another.  
4. **Verify warranty validity** based on blockchain timestamps.  
5. **Retrieve product information** — including owner and warranty status — anytime.
